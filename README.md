# Holistic Testing Approach written mostly in Python, using Behave, Playwright and k6

***This project is a port to Python from my [Ruby automation suite](https://github.com/matiasleandronunez/ruby_automation_suite), because if the industry demands Python, Python it'll get**


This project showcases a holistic testing approach, leveraging mainly Python, Behave, Playwright for API and UI testing, along with JavaScript and k6 for performance tests. The demonstration site includes a REST API backend using [atsea-sample-shop-app](https://github.com/dockersamples/atsea-sample-shop-app/).
